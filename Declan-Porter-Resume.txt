Work experience.
C++ Embedded Programmer, Eranest 2022-Current
● Engineered high-performance C++ firmware for a distributed fleet of real-time IoT devices,
with a strong focus on low-latency, deterministic behavior and multi-threaded design.
● Designed and implemented the Aqua Scanner, a robust, latency-optimized device that
reduced water expenditure by approximately 20%, leveraging event-driven architecture and
real-time signal processing
● Built the Aqua Meter, a highly reliable flow measurement device that provides actionable
telemetry to property managers—enabling data-driven decisions and measurable cost
savings
● Integrated all embedded devices into a .NET-based control and configuration platform,
deployed on Microsoft Azure, supporting remote OTA updates and diagnostics at scale
● Utilized the MQTT protocol for efficient, low-overhead telemetry and command/control
messaging across a constrained network of edge devices—ensuring reliable communication
under fluctuating connectivity conditions.
Junior Software Engineer, BBD, 2021-2022
● Participated in a structured graduate program for junior software engineers, gaining
hands-on experience in software development.
● Used Docker, Kubernetes and Grafana to deploy and monitor financial applications for
Standard Bank, ensuring high availability and scalability of services.
Education
● Bachelors of Computer Science 2021, major in Applied Mathematics, from Nelson Mandela
University.
Projects
Real-Time Market Simulation Using ESP32 Microcontroller Trader Nodes
● A simple, experimental market simulator designed to explore market microstructure and
algorithmic trading mechanics. It includes a basic TCP/UDP-based order book engine with
desktop and ESP32 clients simulating trading behavior.
Open Source Contributions to the C++ Espressif IoT Development Framework
● Fixed issue I encountered in sample code regarding ESP32 microcontrollers LCD screens.
Python Blender Addons
● Developed a Python addon that improves texture management at large scales.
● Developed a Python addon that automatically generated Sci-Fi panels.
